# Tech Shop - Backend

Tech Shop is a robust and scalable e-commerce platform built with a microservices architecture. It leverages the power of gRPC for efficient, high-performance communication between services.

This project demonstrates the practical application of microservices in developing a comprehensive e-commerce platform. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality, ensuring a high degree of modularity and scalability.

Stay tuned for more features and improvements as we continue to expand and refine Tech Shop.
